# noratech_telegram_bot
Telegram bot based on Node which helps the workers of the Noratech company to enter the reports of their work on .
It is much more convenient for a worker to enter the data of their work from the smartphone than to open the site and enter everything manually. 
Through the bot I managed to make the interface even more user friendly since arxivar has not the best gui.
Ps. I made this bot when I was 17 and it was my first time with Javasrcipt, Json and APIs, the entire code has been made in 3 weeks (inluding the time to learn those technologies).

I've used [Telegraf](https://telegraf.js.org/) as framework and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for http requests
